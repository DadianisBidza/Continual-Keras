# Continual-Keras
Keras implementations of various continual learning methods, to be later used in a unified testing/evaluation framework. 

Most of the implementation details are based around [GMvandeVen's pyTorch continual learning framework](https://github.com/GMvandeVen/continual-learning).
AdamW optimizer implementation is from [GLambard's AdamW_Keras](https://github.com/GLambard/AdamW_Keras).
